/**
 * @description
 * Server actions for interacting with the OpenRouter API to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs)
 * for music curation tasks, such as generating track suggestions and playlist metadata.
 * These actions are intended to be called from other server actions or server components.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - `generateTracksForPlaylistViaOpenRouterAction`: (Stub) Action to generate a list of track suggestions
 *   based on a system prompt, user query, and desired track count.
 * - `generatePlaylistNameAndDescriptionViaOpenRouterAction`: (Stub) Action to generate a playlist name
 *   and description based on a list of tracks and a theme.
 *
 * @dependencies
 * - `@/types`: For `ActionState` and `OpenRouterTrackSuggestion` types.
 * - `@/lib/openrouter-client`: (Will be used in full implementation) For making API calls to OpenRouter.
 *
 * @notes
 * - These are initial stub implementations as per Step 5.3 of the implementation plan.
 *   The actual LLM calls and more sophisticated logic will be added in subsequent steps.
 * - All actions are server-side only (`"use server"`).
 * - Robust error handling and input validation are included even in the stub phase.

/**
 * (Stub) Generates a list of track suggestions for a playlist using the OpenRouter API.
 * This action will take a system prompt, user-specific query data, and a desired track count,
 * then interact with an LLM to get track recommendations.
 *
 * @param systemPrompt - The system prompt to guide the LLM (e.g., personality, output format).
 * @param userQueryData - An object containing user-specific context or query details.
 *                        The structure of this object may vary based on the generation method.
 *                        (e.g., for track match, it might contain seed track details).
 * @param trackCount - The desired number of tracks for the playlist.
 * @returns A Promise resolving to an `ActionState`.
 *          On success (stubbed), `data` contains an array of `OpenRouterTrackSuggestion` objects.
 *          On failure, `isSuccess` is false and `message` contains error details.
