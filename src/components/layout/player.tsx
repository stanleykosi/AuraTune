/**
 * @description
 * Placeholder client component for the AuraTune application's music player bar.
 * The player bar will provide controls for Spotify music playback, display current
 * track information, and manage playback state.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Declared as a client component (`"use client"`) to handle interactivity and state.
 * - Occupies a fixed area at the bottom of the screen.
 * - Styled with Tailwind CSS for a consistent look and feel.
 *
 * @dependencies
 * - `react`: For JSX and component definition.
 *
 * @notes
 * - This is an initial placeholder. UI elements for playback controls (play/pause,
 *   next/previous, volume, progress bar), track display (album art, name, artist),
 *   and actual functionality will be implemented in subsequent steps (specifically Step 3.3 and Phase 9).
 * - It's designed to be part of the `AppLayout` for authenticated users.
